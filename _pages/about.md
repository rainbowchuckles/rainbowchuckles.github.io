Hey! I'm Joe, a post-doctoral researcher in hypersonics at the University of Oxford, welcome to my website . Here I keep a record of what I'm up to in my research, write about what interests me, give some opinions, and generally document my life. Come along for the ride.

If you are looking for something specific, please see the navigation bar at the top of the page. There you will find my [CV](/cv/), [projects](/projects/) I have been working on, a list of [publications](/publications/), and more. I also have a [blog](/blog/) page which I sporadically update. 

Links to my social media and other websites can be found at the bottom of this page. I prefer to be contacted via email, but I do check other platforms fairly frequently.
