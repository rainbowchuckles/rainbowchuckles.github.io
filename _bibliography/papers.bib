	title = {The {Oxford} {T6} {Stalker} tunnel: performance, upgrades and new modes of operation},
	abstract = {The T6 Stalker tunnel is a multi-mode high enthalpy pulse facility for testing of aerothermodynamics for high speed flight. It operates with a free-piston driver and can be coupled to several different components downstream to become a shock tube, reflected shock tunnel or an expansion tube. This allows for a wide range of testing from subscale model testing to exploration of fundamental high-speed flow processes. Its development was initiated in 2014 with its first commissioning beginning in 2017. Eight years from its conception, has seen its successful commissioning in all modes of operation. Research has been conducted in several fields including shock layer thermochemistry and radiation, convective heating and boundary layer transition. Additional hardware has been developed to expand its capability and operability. This paper will highlight the performance of the facility in each of its modes now that it has been operated against the overall performance map for the facility. Some of the research performed in the facility, including radiation testing, satellite demise and sub-scale planetary probe testing, is also presented.},

The PWK1 facility at the Institute of Space Systems of the University of Stuttgart has been modiﬁed in order to be used with hydrogen-helium mixtures. Additionally, methane was injected aiming at investigating the inﬂuence of methane on the radiation behavior. Methane could signiﬁcantly change the radiative heating behavior during the entry ﬂight. Based on ﬁrst emission spectroscopic measurements, it is shown that methane inﬂuences the spectra behavior considerably. CH and C2 moleular radiation appear and the overall radiation level is higher. The prominent hydrogen Balmer series are saturating the spectrometer, which needs further attention in future measurements.},

	doi = {10.2514/6.2023-1729},
	abstract = {The Ice Giants, Uranus and Neptune, represent a largely unexplored, interstitial class of planetary objects that fit between the Gas Giants and the smaller terrestrial worlds, such as Earth, in terms of their size and elemental composition and are therefore a missing link in our understanding of extrasolar planetary evolution. The scientific potential of a mission to the Ice Giants is well recognised and has been identified by NASA and ESA as a high priority on several occasions, most recently in the 2023 - 2032 Decadal Survey. The payload capacity of such a spacecraft is limited by the requirement for a bulky heat shield, made necessary by the paucity of ground test data for convective and radiative heat flux at proposed entry trajectories. This paper describes an experimental study of shock layer radiation via emission spectroscopy at Ice Giant entry conditions in the T6 free-piston driven wind tunnel. Significant engineering upgrades have been made to T6 that extend the performance envelope and allow operation with flammable test gases. Shock waves of up to 18.9 km/s were driven through H-He mixtures containing up to 5\% CH4 by mole. The magnitude of spectral radiance at the peak and in the immediate post-shock region appears to be strongly affected by the concentration of CH4 in the test gas. Spectral fitting with the NEQAIR program shows that radiation in the 410 - 560 nm range is dominated by C2 and CH and has allowed the spatial evolution of mode temperatures and species concentrations to be extracted.},

	title = {Experimental study of a galileo sub-scale model at ice giant entry conditions in the {T6} free-piston driven wind tunnel},
	doi = {10.2514/6.2023-1339},
	abstract = {Uranus and Neptune, known collectively as the Ice Giants, are the only two planets in the solar system that are yet to be explored with a dedicated mission. Planetary entry probe missions to the Ice Giants were proposed in 2010 by NASA and ESA which prompted a resurgence of interest in experimental simulation of the aeroheating environment that would be encountered by such a spacecraft. More recently, the 2023 - 2032 Decadal Survey recommended that NASA’s highest priority new flagship mission should be a Uranus orbiter and probe with a launch date in the early 2030s. The Oxford T6 Stalker tunnel is the only facility in Europe capable of replicating the high speeds required for Ice Giant entry and is therefore a key stepping stone on the path to realising the goal of an Ice Giant mission. In the present work, a 1:10 scaled model of the Galileo probe has been tested at Ice Giant entry conditions. Conditions for nominal composition (85\%H2-15\%He), Stalker substituted, and nominal composition with methane (0.5\% and 5\% CH4) gas mixtures have been developed and validated for use with a new expansion nozzle via a Pitot rake survey. Test flows with flight equivalent velocities greater than 18 km/s have been produced with test times on the order of 30 micro seconds. Heat flux into the model for the developed conditions has been inferred from temperature measurements with a series of coaxial thermocouples. High speed video, with and without schlieren, has been captured to aid in characterisation of the test conditions.},

The payload capacity of such a spacecraft is limited by the heat shield thickness, which must be sized conservatively due to a lack of reliable data for convective and radiative heat flux along the proposed entry trajectories. Major upgrades to the Oxford T6 Stalker Tunnel have been commissioned that allow study of giant planet entry trajectories, including a flammable gas handling system, a Mach 10 expansion nozzle, and a steel shock tube with optical access. Initial testing has been completed in shock tube and expansion tunnel modes, with peak shock speeds of 18.9 km/s achieved. Convective heat flux and surface pressure were measured at several locations on a 45° sphere cone model in expansion tunnel mode. Measurements of the radiating shock layer were made in shock tube mode to assess the effect of CH4 concentration.

	doi = {10.2514/6.2024-0447},
	abstract = {Shock tube experiments provide critical insight into the thermochemical processes that occur in the shock layer of hypersonic flight vehicles and are used to validate many chemical-kinetic and radiative models for vehicle design. Shock tube flows exhibit a number of non-ideal behaviours that must be accounted for when interpreting experimental data. Previous work has shown that variations in shock speed and boundary layer growth along the length of the shock tube have a strong effect on the test slug properties. The LAgrangian Shock Tube Analysis code (LASTA) is an a posteriori tool that successfully addressed this problem, allowing reconstruction of the test slug from an experimentally obtained shock trajectory. LASTA 2.0 is presented here, which further constrains the test slug properties using an additional experimental pressure boundary condition whose effects are included via a backwards time integration scheme. The tool is validated against ideal gas cases following accelerating and decelerating shock trajectories, each with a tube-end Mach number of 6.5 and a fill pressure of 66.66 Pa. Agreement between the method and results from a viscous, axisymmetric Navier-Stokes solution is found to be within 1\% in pressure and temperature in the majority of cases. Improved agreement with experimental data is evident when compared to the previous version of LASTA, particularly where there is strong shock speed non-uniformity.},

	abstract = {Shock tube experiments are used to investigate non-equilibrium thermochemistry and radiative processes in reacting gas hypersonic flows. Boundary layer and shock structure are known to influence the spatial variation of the test slug state properties. This work derives and validates a novel method for viscous, quasi-one-dimensional, non-equilibrium flow in a shock tube assuming constant shock speed. The proposed method fully resolves the shock structure. Mirels’ estimate for boundary layer growth around the test slug determines the dilation rate at the centerline. This, along with relevant boundary conditions, appropriately models core flow in a shock tube. The flow equations are discretized by finite differences on a staggered grid. The resulting highly non-linear set of algebraic equations is solved by Newton iterations. The Jacobian matrix is block tridiagonal with a Schur complement, allowing efficient inversion. This culminates in a unique and computationally efficient quasi-one-dimensional method offering improved modeling of the physical characteristics of shock tube experiments. Results of a 3 km/s, 66.6 Pa argon test case solved by a viscous, axisymmetric Navier–Stokes solution had agreement with the proposed method in temperature and pressure profiles to within 2\% and post-shock velocity to within 15\%. Reacting gas shock tube experiments in synthetic air and synthetic Titan atmospheres were analyzed. Radiance values in the non-equilibrium and equilibrium regions were compared under various assumptions for the shock structure and radial velocity distribution. These results highlight the necessity of a dedicated shock tube solver when analyzing shock tube thermochemistry, particularly when determining reaction rates and relaxation parameters.},

	abstract = {Impulse facilities, such as shock tubes and expansion tubes, serve as crucial tools for interrogation of the thermochemical processes occurring in the shock layer surrounding hypersonic vehicles. Measurements made in these facilities are used to deduce reaction rate coefficients for chemical-kinetic models that are ultimately used for vehicle design. Expansion tubes leverage an unsteady expansion flow process to achieve large total enthalpies. This has been shown to lead to thermochemical freezing of the freestream in some cases, a fact that drives uncertainty in results obtained from these facilities. Integrated radiance measurements of the oxygen 777 nm and hydrogen 656 nm atomic lines have been made at several points downstream of the secondary diaphragm of the T6 Stalker tunnel in expansion tube mode. A radiometer probe design suitable for use in the tube wall was developed and validated against measurements made via optical emission spectroscopy. Measurements made downstream of the secondary diaphragm clearly visualise the unsteady expansion and indicate a test time that is in agreement with pressure measurements. Absolute radiance values during the test time are higher than those predicted by equilibrium, state-to-state analysis, indicating the need for improved modelling tools for expansion tube flows.},

	doi = {10.2514/6.2025-2159},
	abstract = {Recent work in the field of shock tube modelling has highlighted that shock speed non-uniformity strongly affects the thermochemical state of the test gas in many cases. As an extension to the shock tube, expansion tubes are certain to inherit this issue in addition to possible thermochemical freezing of the freestream gas through the unsteady expansion. This is a clear need for a new numerical tool that can account for both non-equilibrium and shock speed non-uniformity, as well as improved experimental measurements of the thermochemical state of the expansion tube freestream. The capabilities of a Lagrangian shock tube model known as LASTA 2.0 have been extended to include expansion tube modelling in the present work. This was achieved by treating the shock tube and acceleration tube as separate domains with the final test gas state in the shock tube used as the initial state for the acceleration tube. This approach was verified numerically against results from a viscous, axisymmetric Navier-Stokes method in pure argon, where test-time averaged properties agreed within 7 \%. The method was then applied to expansion tube results in synthetic air and Titan relevant mixtures. Strong thermal non-equilibrium or the order of 500 K was predicted for the Titan case, with appreciable N2 recombination evident in the synthetic air case. These results demonstrate the necessity of the new method.},
