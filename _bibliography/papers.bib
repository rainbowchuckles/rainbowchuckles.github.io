	abstract = {Shock tube experiments are used to investigate non-equilibrium thermochemistry and radiative processes in reacting gas hypersonic flows. Boundary layer and shock structure are known to influence the spatial variation of the test slug state properties. This work derives and validates a novel method for viscous, quasi-one-dimensional, non-equilibrium flow in a shock tube assuming constant shock speed. The proposed method fully resolves the shock structure. Mirels’ estimate for boundary layer growth around the test slug determines the dilation rate at the centerline. This, along with relevant boundary conditions, appropriately models core flow in a shock tube. The flow equations are discretized by finite differences on a staggered grid. The resulting highly non-linear set of algebraic equations is solved by Newton iterations. The Jacobian matrix is block tridiagonal with a Schur complement, allowing efficient inversion. This culminates in a unique and computationally efficient quasi-one-dimensional method offering improved modeling of the physical characteristics of shock tube experiments. Results of a 3 km/s, 66.6 Pa argon test case solved by a viscous, axisymmetric Navier–Stokes solution had agreement with the proposed method in temperature and pressure profiles to within 2\% and post-shock velocity to within 15\%. Reacting gas shock tube experiments in synthetic air and synthetic Titan atmospheres were analyzed. Radiance values in the non-equilibrium and equilibrium regions were compared under various assumptions for the shock structure and radial velocity distribution. These results highlight the necessity of a dedicated shock tube solver when analyzing shock tube thermochemistry, particularly when determining reaction rates and relaxation parameters.},
